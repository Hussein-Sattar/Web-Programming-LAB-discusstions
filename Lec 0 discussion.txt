3. Is the best for web developer to be full stack development or just one type of development ??

ans/: 

It's up to the developer and his preferences, it's enough to learn one type of development 
but if you do so you should be very professional at it.

On the other hand, if you're an ambitious person it's better to learn full-stuck developement and have 
hight skills at both client side and server side.
